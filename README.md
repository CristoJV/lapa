# LAPA (Locally Adversarial Patch Algorithm) 🐚

## 📌 Description
LAPA (Locally Adversarial Patch Algorithm) is a model designed to 
generate adversarial patches capable of fooling object detectors like 
YOLO.

🎯 Goal: Develop optimized adversarial patches that effectively disrupt 
object detection models, making specific objects undetectable or 
misclassified.

## **🌍 Inspired by the Canary Islands**  
🐚 **LAPA** is named after the **Canarian limpet (lapa)**, which clings 
tightly to surfaces and blends into its surroundings—just like this 
patch attaches to objects and makes them invisible to detectors.
